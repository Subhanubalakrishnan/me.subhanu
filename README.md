👋 About Me

Hi, I'm Subhanu Balakrishnan, 2025 graduate in Electronics and Communication Engineering student with a strong interest in software development. I enjoy building practical and user-friendly applications using C, Java, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

I am someone who likes solving problems through logic and code, and I continuously work on improving my technical skills by creating projects and learning new tools. I’m currently looking for opportunities where I can contribute, learn, and grow as a Software Developer in a real-world environment.
